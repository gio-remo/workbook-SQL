### Lesson 02 - Working with DATE/TIME Functions and Operators

1) Subtract the rental_date from the return_date to calculate the number of days_rented

```
SELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,
    -- Calculate the number of days rented
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
     INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
     INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
```

2) Now use the AGE() function to calculate the days_rented

```
SELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,
    -- Calculate the number of days rented
	AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date) AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
	INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
	INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
```

3) 

```
SELECT
	f.title,
 	-- Convert the rental_duration to an interval
    INTERVAL '1' day * f.rental_duration,
 	-- Calculate the days rented as we did previously
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
-- Filter the query to exclude outstanding rentals
WHERE r.return_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.title;
```

### Functions for retrieving current date/time

- CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NOW() or NOW()::timestamp
- CURRENT_DATE
- CURRENT_TIME

4) 

```
SELECT NOW();

SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

--Select the current timestamp without a timezone
SELECT CAST( NOW() AS timestamp )

SELECT
	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(0)::timestamp AS right_now,
    interval '5 days' + CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(0) AS five_days_from_now;
```

### Extracting and transforming date / time data

EXTRACT(field FROM source) or DATE_PART('field', source)

5) 

```
-- Extract day of week from rental_date
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(dow FROM rental_date) AS dayofweek, 
  -- Count the number of rentals
  COUNT(*) as rentals 
FROM rental 
GROUP BY 1;
```

The DATE_TRUNC() function will truncate timestamp or interval data types

6) 

```
-- Truncate rental_date by month
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', rental_date) AS rental_month
FROM rental;
```

7) 

```
SELECT 
  c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name,
  f.title,
  r.rental_date,
  -- Extract the day of week date part from the rental_date
  EXTRACT(dow FROM r.rental_date) AS dayofweek,
  AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date) AS rental_days,
  -- Use DATE_TRUNC to get days from the AGE function
  CASE WHEN DATE_TRUNC('day', AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date)) > 
  -- Calculate number of d
    f.rental_duration * INTERVAL '1' day 
  THEN TRUE 
  ELSE FALSE END AS past_due 
FROM 
  film AS f 
  INNER JOIN inventory AS i 
  	ON f.film_id = i.film_id 
  INNER JOIN rental AS r 
  	ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
  INNER JOIN customer AS c 
  	ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id 
WHERE 
  -- Use an INTERVAL for the upper bound of the rental_date 
  r.rental_date BETWEEN CAST('2005-05-01' AS DATE) 
  AND CAST('2005-05-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 day';
```
