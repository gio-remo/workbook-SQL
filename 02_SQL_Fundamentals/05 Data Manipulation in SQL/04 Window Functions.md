# SQL Fundamentals

## Data Manipulation in SQL

### Lesson 04 - Window Functions

### OVER() and RANK() functions

Working with aggregate values requires you to use GROUP BY with **all** non-aggregate columns.

Windows Functions are processed **after** every part of query except ORDER BY. Uses information in result set rather than database!

Available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server but NOT SQLite.

The **OVER()** clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select, namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include.

1) Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;
```

2) Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;
```

3) 

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;
```

### Window Partitions

Calculate *separate* values for different categories.

The **PARTITION BY** clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results.

4) Creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), and compare their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

```
SELECT
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
		 ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
    -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_homeavg,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673 
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;
```

The **PARTITION BY** clause can be used to break out window averages by **multiple data points** (columns).

5) 

```
SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
         ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
	-- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(month FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
            EXTRACT(month FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;
```

### Sliding windows

- Perform calculations relative to the current **row**
- Can be used to calculate running totals, sums, averages, etc
- Can be partitioned by one or more columns

Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW.

6) 

```
SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total,
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 9908 
	AND season = '2011/2012';
```

7) 

```
-- Set up the home team CTE
WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
-- Set up the away team CTE
away AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select columns and and rank the matches by goal difference
SELECT DISTINCT
    m.date,
    home.team_long_name AS home_team,
    away.team_long_name AS away_team,
    m.home_goal, m.away_goal,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ABS(home_goal - away_goal) DESC) as match_rank
-- Join the CTEs onto the match table
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
LEFT JOIN AWAY ON m.id = away.id
WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
	  AND ((home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND home.outcome = 'MU Loss')
	  OR (away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND away.outcome = 'MU Loss'));
```
